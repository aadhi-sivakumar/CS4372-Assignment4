# CS 4372 Assignment-4

## Instructions to Run the Code

1. **Download the file** `CS4372- Assignment-4.ipynb` to your computer.

2. **Open Google Colab**  
   Visit [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)

3. **Upload the notebook**  
   - In Colab, click on **Upload**
   - Select the `CS4372- Assignment-4.ipynb` file from your computer
     
4. **Change the runtime to T4 GPU**
   - Click **Runtime → Change runtime type → T4 GPU** from the menu bar

5. **Run the cells**  
   Once the notebook loads in Colab, you can either:
   - Click the **Run (▶️)** button on the left of each cell to run them one by one, OR
   - Click **Runtime → Run all** from the menu bar to execute all cells at once

5. **Execute sequentially**  
   - Make sure you run all cells sequentially from **top to bottom**
   - Do not skip any cells, since later parts of the notebook may depend on earlier ones

## Notes

- Ensure you are signed into your Google account to use Colab.
- If you encounter any errors, try restarting the runtime and running all cells again from the beginning.
- Some cells may take time to execute, especially if they involve data processing or model training.
